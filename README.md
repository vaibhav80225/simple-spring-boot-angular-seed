# simple-spring-boot-angular-seed
This example demonstrates how Spring Boot and in the front-end Angular can be used together to write web applications easily.

# Front-end

Angular

Angular is a MVC based framework for web applications, written in JavaScript. It makes it possible to use the Model-View-Controller pattern on the front-end. 

# Back-end

Spring Boot

One of the hassles while creating web applications using the Spring Framework is that it involves a lot of configuration. Spring Boot makes it possible to write configuration-less web application because it does a lot for you out of the box.

# Installation

Installation is quite easy, first you will have to install some front-end dependencies using npm:

you just need to go in webapp dierctory(which contain your angular code) and run this command -

<code>npm install</code></br>
<code>npm build</code>

Installation is quite easy, first you will have to install some Back-end dependencies using mvn:

Go into the main directory and run- 

<code>mvn clean package</code>

Now you can run the Java application quite easily.

<code>mvn spring-boot:run</code>
